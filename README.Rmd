## What is a tidyflow? 

<!-- A tidyflow is an object that can bundle together your data, splitting, resampling, preprocessing, modeling, and post-processing requests. For example, if you have a `recipe` and `parsnip` model, these can be combined into a workflow. The advantages are: -->

<!--  * You don't have to keep track of separate objects in your workspace. -->

<!--  * The recipe prepping and model fitting can be executed using a single call to `fit()`. -->

<!--  * If you have custom tuning parameter settings, these can be defined using a simpler interface when combined with [tune](https://github.com/tidymodels/tune). -->

<!--  * In the future, workflows will be able to add post-processing operations, such as modifying the probability cutoff for two-class models. -->
 
## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cimentadaj/tidyflow")
```
 
## Example

```{r }
library(tidymodels)
library(tidyflow)

# Build tidyflow
tflow <-
  mtcars %>%
  tidyflow() %>%
  plug_split(initial_split) %>%
  plug_formula(mpg ~ .) %>%
  plug_model(linear_reg())

# Fit model
fit_m <- fit(tflow)

# Predict on testing
fit_m %>%
  predict_testing()

```
